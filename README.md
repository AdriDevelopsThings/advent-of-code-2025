# advent-of-code-2025
My advent of code solutions for year 2025 written in C.

## Building
Just run `make all`. The executable `aoc` should appear in the directory.

## Running
Put your input file into a directory called `input` as `{day_nr}.txt`. (For example for day one `input/1.txt`)
Then run
```
./aoc <DAY> <PART>
```
